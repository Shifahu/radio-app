##General
Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
    Tried to find a way to add the current song and the cover art, but I have had trouble trying to find the API endpoint for this
Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
    Getting the audio tag to render the radio stations and the channels to be alternated the next and back button
Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
    Getting the radio station to render, I kept on using the url from the search bar so it wasn't rendering
Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
    Mainly with the APIs, I think if I could find a way to access this I would've been able to fulfil the requirements.
